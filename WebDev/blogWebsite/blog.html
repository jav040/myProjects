    	<h2> This is my first article </h2>

<P class="quote">How relevant is the infornation from a University's Computer Science program to what is actually being applied in Industry (Yes, the software industry FWI). This is a question that I always pondered on during the period of time that I spent incarcerated in APS (Academic Penal System). Are you better off spending a few months self learning from the plethora of online teaching services that seem to be propogating our 'recommended playlist' at the rate of the African Driver Ant reproduction; or are you better off sacrificing your sanity, physical and mental health, and any semblance of a social life for 7 years of school (oh wait that was just me?.. cool) </P>

<p>There are a few parameters that need to be established before: 1.) This is purely my experience 2.) University was located in the U.S. 3.) I am the first in my family to attend school (evidently, nobody at home to provide reference as to what to expect). With that being said, I am going to come straight out and say "It depends", you're probably pissed right? I used to absolutely despise the vaguness that such a response would give, but allow me to elaborate. The domain of 'Industry' itself is vastly different from Academia. The guidelines and axioms that define their respective structures are innately and fundamentally different. Imagine if you will that it's a hot summmer day, and you're spending it a generic water park. You begrudgingly cave in to the peer pressure of your friends, and go ride one of the scary waterslide tube thingy rides. The already built tube provides a predictable, established sense of direction with every curve. Because the ride maintenance crew guy in charge of this ride just got hit with an eviction notice, his distracted mind inhibited his already poor attention to detail, and he forgot to lubricate this slide with a sufficient water stream to propel you down. So you're in this tube, and eventually must resort paddling your own self down the slide because the stream below you is not providing enough you enough momentum to continue effortlessly sliding. Oh and you leg rashes up from scratching the interior of the slide. Okay so you're finally out of the ride, you preservered, scratched up and a bit rattled from having to have paddled your own self down the ride, but you now claim bragging rights to having completed this to your friends. By contrast, suppose you decided to spend this hot summer day at a California beach, and you've accepted your friends challenge to swim from the beach front to an empty floating water bottle roughly 1000 yards out. During your swim, you must overcome the vicous rip tides, killer sharks, oh and you have no tube like structure guiding your movements. </p>

        <p> Okay story time is over, if you followed along, hopefully you were able to deduce where I was going with this. School is the tubed water slide, you will encounter difficult times to lay claim to having completed the ride, but your thrill ride domain always provided you a <b>direction</b> to follow. The ocean however provided much more consequential obstacles, accompanied by zero direction. So there you have it, as objectively as possible, the gap between Academia and Industry. In Academia, you endulge in theory, confronted with various challenges in the form of exams, projects, etc., and no doubt with encounter tough times. However, you are also buttressed by an inherent sense of direction, and thus can find solace in knowing that more thna likely, a sufficient amount of effort and fortitude will help you accomplish your end goal. Industry on the other hand, the challenges are more fierce (often you're working with software that directly affects people's lives in some shape or form), you do not have a course calendar or curriculum to have a sense of predictability, and most importantly there is no direciton. By that I mean that the direction you must take is dictated completely by mothger nature herself-A service your company suddenly breaks down, you gotta figure it out, a member of one of your services decides to try and cheat the system, you have to figure out whether you service failed or not.</p>
